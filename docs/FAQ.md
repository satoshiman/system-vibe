# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Why organize Redis as a separate package?

Organizing Redis as a separate package (`@systemvibe/redis`) in the monorepo provides the following benefits:

**1. Reusability**

- Redis client can be used by multiple apps (API, worker, other microservices)
- Avoids code duplication when multiple services need to connect to Redis

**2. Single Responsibility**

- Package only handles Redis connection management
- Singleton pattern ensures only 1 connection instance
- Retry logic and error handling are centralized

**3. Configuration Centralization**

- Redis URL, retry strategy, timeout are configured in one place
- Easy to change configuration without affecting other apps

**4. Testing & Mocking**

- Easy to mock Redis client when testing other apps
- Can test Redis package independently

**5. Dependency Management**

- `ioredis` dependency is managed in one package
- Apps only need to depend on `@systemvibe/redis` instead of installing ioredis directly

**6. Scalability**

- Easy to add new features (connection pool, multi-instance, cluster)
- Can evolve into a shared library for the entire organization

In monorepo architecture, this pattern is typically applied to shared services: database, cache, message queue, logging, etc.

### Where should JWT be stored: localStorage or Cookie?

For SystemVibe, JWT should be stored in **HttpOnly Cookies** rather than localStorage.

**HttpOnly Cookies (Recommended):**

- **XSS Protection**: HttpOnly cookies cannot be accessed by JavaScript, preventing XSS attacks from stealing tokens
- **CSRF Protection**: Can be combined with SameSite and CSRF tokens
- **Automatic sending**: Browser automatically includes cookies with requests
- **Security**: More secure by default for authentication tokens

**localStorage (Not Recommended for JWT):**

- **XSS Vulnerable**: Any malicious JavaScript can access localStorage and steal tokens
- **Manual handling**: Must manually attach token to request headers
- **No expiration control**: Browser doesn't automatically clear expired tokens

**Implementation approach for SystemVibe:**

1. Backend sets HttpOnly cookie with JWT on login
2. Configure cookie with: `httpOnly: true`, `secure: true` (HTTPS), `sameSite: 'strict'`
3. Backend validates JWT from cookie instead of Authorization header
4. Add CSRF protection if needed (though SameSite=strict mitigates most CSRF)

**Exception:** localStorage might be acceptable if:

- Your app has zero XSS risk (rare)
- You need token access from multiple subdomains
- You're implementing additional XSS mitigation (CSP, input sanitization)
